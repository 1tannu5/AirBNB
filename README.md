# AirBNB
The dataset comprises Airbnb listings from four cities: Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, and Istanbul. Each dataset includes details such as the listing ID, name, host information, location (latitude and longitude), room type, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, availability, and other relevant information.

### Summary of Analysis Steps:
1. **Loading the Data**: The CSV files for each city were loaded into pandas DataFrames to facilitate analysis.
2. **Initial Inspection**: The first few rows of each dataset were displayed to understand the structure and content of the data.
3. **Visualization Goals**: Key visualizations were planned, including:
    - Distribution of room types in each city.
    - Average price of different room types in each city.
    - Distribution of availability (in days) over the next year for each city.
    - Average number of reviews per month for listings in each city.
4. **Plotting**: We intended to use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for creating these visualizations to provide insights into the types and pricing of accommodations, host activity levels, and availability patterns in each city.
